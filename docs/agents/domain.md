# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

This is a **single-context** repo: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root cover the whole Dotty stack. (Note: `CLAUDE.md` at the root is the always-on architecture reference and the authoritative starting point regardless — `CONTEXT.md` is the lazily-grown domain glossary the producer skills maintain.)

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── CLAUDE.md          ← always-on architecture reference (already exists)
├── CONTEXT.md         ← domain glossary (created lazily by /grill-with-docs)
├── docs/adr/          ← architectural decision records (created lazily)
│   ├── 0001-....md
│   └── 0002-....md
└── ...
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (...) — but worth reopening because…_
